Alice and Bob exchanges a key using Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol. Which of the followings do Alice know by the end of the protocol? Select all that applies.|The prime modulus (p)$Bob's public key (Y_B)$The primitive root of the prime modulus (a)$The shared key by the protocol (K)
Alice and Bob exchanges a key using Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol. Which of the followings are to be secret against a passive attacker (who wishes to learn the shared key)? Select all that applies.|Bob's private key (Y_B)$The shared key by the protocol (K)
Alice and Bob uses Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange to share a key with a common prime p=11 and a primitive root a=2. If Alice has a public key Y_A=9, what is her private key X_A?|6
(This question builds on the previous question.) Alice and Bob uses Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange to share a key with a common prime p=11 and a primitive root a=2. If Bob has a public key Y_B=3, what is the secret key K shared with Alice?|3
Which of the followings are true for Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack? Select all that applies.|Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol is vulnerable to MITM attack because of the lack of authentication.
Which of the followings are true about El Gamal Encryption?|El Gamal Encryption includes the message and the key that is used to protect the message, and the key itself is protected against eavesdropping.$El Gamal Encryption uses a prime modulus and a primitive root of the modulus.
