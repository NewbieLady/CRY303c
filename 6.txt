Let's use Vigenere Cipher to encrypt English text, ignoring capitalization and other symbols beyond English alphabets. The key is of length 1 and of value "Y" or 24, i.e., the key is "Y". Which of the following statements is false?|This cipher transforms a plaintext alphabet to distinct ciphertext alphabets with long enough plaintext inputs.
Vigenere cipher is used with a key "XO". What is the ciphertext corresponding to the plaintext, DRAGON?|AFXULB
Vigenere cipher is used with a key "XO" to encrypt a long English book, comprised of English alphabet letters and ignoring capitalization and other symbols. The key length is fixed, i.e., the key is 2 alphabets long. What is the number of possible distinct keys?|676
Vigenere cipher is used with a key "XO" to encrypt a long English book. You order the letters appearing in the encrypted book in the decreasing order of frequency (i.e., from the most frequently appearing to the least frequently appearing), and the result is: RGZNFIBJWPESCXHTMYAUOLDKVQ. Which ciphertext letters correspond to the plaintext letter E (which is the most frequent letter in the plaintext)? Apply all those that apply.|R$G
