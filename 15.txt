What is the Euler Totient Function of 12, phi(12)?|4
Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=5, q=11, e=3. What is the value of phi(n) where phi(n) is the Euler Totient function of n and n is the modulus for RSA cipher?|40
(This question builds on the previous question.) Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=5, q=11, e=3. Using the phi(n) that you found in the previous question and the Extended Euclidean algorithm yields d=27. What is the ciphertext C when encrypting M=9?|14
Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=7, q=11, e=17. What is the value of phi(n) where phi(n) is the Euler Totient function of n and n is the modulus for RSA cipher?|60
(This question builds on the previous question.) Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=7, q=11, e=17. Using the phi(n) that you found in the previous question and the Extended Euclidean algorithm yields d=53. What is the ciphertext C when encrypting M=8?|57
