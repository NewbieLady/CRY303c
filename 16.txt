Using the same notations as in the lecture, p and q are the two prime factors of n, and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively. Which of the followings are to be secret against the attacker, assuming that the Prime Factorization problem remains difficult to solve?|p$q$The Euler totient function of n, phi(n)$d
Using the same notations as in the lecture, p and q are the two prime factors of n, and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively. Which of the following statements about the RSA cipher are true? Select all that applies.|After choosing d, the Extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to derive e.$After choosing e, the Extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to derive d.$For the public-private keys of RSA, e and d, given any plaintext m, m raised to the power of e.d (m^{e.d}) is equal to m.
Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=5, q=11. Alice chooses a private key d and derives the public key e. Which of the followings can work for the values of d?|17$21$9
Using the same notations as in the lecture, e.g., p and q are the two primes and e and d are the public key and the private key, respectively, p=3, q=11, and e=7. The attacker performs a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA). It has a known ciphertext 14 and wants to retrieve the corresponding plaintext. It computes c' = c * r^e mod n and chooses the ciphertext 14 * 2187 mod 33 = 27 and retrieves the corresponding plaintext, 15. What is the plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext 14?|5
