Which of the following statements are false for hash functions?|Given an input, a hash function can produce multiple outputs
Which of the following terms are used to describe the output of the hash function?|Hash value$Fingerprint$Digest
Which of the followings states that for any given input, it is computationally infeasible to find another input that produces the same hash as the given input|Weak collision resistance
Which of the following statements are true for cryptographic hash function requirements?|Avalanche effect is desirable property of hash function because it prevents attacks that compare the outputs to infer the relations between the corresponding inputs.$Any hash function that is strong collision resistant is also weak collision resistant.
