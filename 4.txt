You agreed to use a Caesar cipher with a key of k=5 with a friend. While sitting in a group, the friend hands you over a message that says "QNGWFWD". Decrypt the message.|LIBRARY
Suppose you actually forgot the key. How many decryption computations of the cipher text "QNGWFWD" do you need to perform to reach to the plaintext? (Consider the worst case.)|25
Your friend proposes an update in the key and suggests a new key, k=523. How many cyclic shifts do you need to perform using the new key? You want to minimize the number of cyclic shifts on the letters.|3
