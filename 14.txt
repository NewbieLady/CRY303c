Given any plaintext p, a cipher supporting asymmetric cryptography with an encryption function (Enc) and the corresponding decryption function (Dec), and the public-private key pair (Ki,ki) for any user i, which of the followings are true for a cipher that can be used for both message confidentiality and source integrity/signature, e.g., RSA cipher? Select all that applies.|Dec(K2,Enc(k2,p))=p$Dec(k1,Enc(K1,p))=p
Which of the followings are true about asymmetric cryptography? Check all that applies.|Key distribution and management should be addressed when using asymmetric cryptography.
Which of the followings are false for asymmetric cipher requirements? Select all that applies.|Both the public key and the private key should remain secret against an attacker.$Both the sender and the receiver can use the same private key for encryption and decryption.
Suppose f is a trapdoor one-way function designed to be used with the key, k. Which of the followings are computationally easy?|Solving f(x) if the input and k are known$Solving the inverse of f if the input to the f-inverse and k are known
Which of the followings does the RSA algorithm support? Select all that apply.|Encryption/decryption$Digital signature$Key exchange
Which of the followings does Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange support: encryption/decryption, digital sig- natures, key exchange? Select all that apply.|Key exchange
