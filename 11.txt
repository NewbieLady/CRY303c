Triple-DES or 3-DES encryption can be characterized by the following: C=Enc(K3,Dec(K2,Enc(K1,P))). Each keys, K1, K2, K3 are 56-bits-long and are independent to each other (the three-key version). The DES block size is 64 bits. Using the big O notation, which of the following best describe the meet-in-the-middle attacker's storage requirement?|O(2^56)
