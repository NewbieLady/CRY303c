The plaintext MEETMELATER gets processed by a product cipher, comprised of Caesar Cipher (with a key of 23) and Permutation Cipher (with a key of [5 3 1 4 2] and no padding with extra letters). What is the corresponding ciphertext?|BXJBBIQQJBO
The same product cipher in the previous question, comprised of Caesar Cipher and Permutation Cipher (with a key of length 5), is again used but with different keys. Given a plaintext, how many distinct ciphertexts can there be?|3120
The same product cipher in the previous question, comprised of Caesar Cipher and Permutation Cipher (with a key of length 5), is used to encrypt a long English book (ignoring capitalization and other symbols beyond English letters). Your friend makes the following claims. Select all those that are correct.|"Letter Z appeared the most in the ciphertext, so it must be mapped from the latter E.$"The ordering between the Caesar and the Permutation does not matter within the product cipher, so we can decrypt it in any order."$"If we replace the Caesar Cipher with a Monoalphabetic Cipher, then it becomes harder to crack by an attacker (who does not know the key)."
