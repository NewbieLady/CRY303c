You are given a stream cipher and a block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. The data input is 32 bits. How many bits do you need to pad before processing the data input using a stream cipher?|0
The block cipher supports input/output of 64 bits. Which of the following is true about the key storage requirement?|You need hundred million to one billion 1TB-hard-drives to store the key, where TB stands for Terabytes.
A block cipher takes a 3-bit plaintext and outputs a 3-bit ciphertext. If the cipher is an ideal block cipher, how many reversible transformations (keys) can it have?|40320
